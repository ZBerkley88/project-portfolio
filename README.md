# Portfolio Project

## Description

The purpose of this project was to develop a framework for a portfolio for its creator, I, the great Zachary Berkley, web developer extraordinaire! 

I was motivated to create a minimalist portfolio because I think less is more. I wanted my portfolio to have a simple and clean look. Too many words can overwhelm a reader. The work should speak for itself.

The original color scheme was modeled on a vaporwave aesthetic, but I later decided to reduce the number of colors on the page to recude the chance of eyestrain.

The biggest hurdle for this project was mastering the box model. I ran into several issues where content would spill over out of their respective containers. I originally wanted the project boxes to be circles, but I was unable to figure out how to fit the image and text into the container. I would like to change that in future versions of this project.

Overall, I am pleased with the look of the project. It does not look anything like the original wireframe blueprint I designed when I first started the project, but I do not believe I "settled" for the final design. I look forward to modifying and adding to this portfolio over the next few months.
